* Synonyms & antonyms (if found)
* Smooth animations + dark mode

You stay on the page‚Äîno new tabs, no clutter.

## FAQ
**The üìñ icon didn‚Äôt show up**  
The selection may be too long, empty, only numbers, or blocked by a special viewer (like an embedded PDF). Try plain text on a normal site.

**Definitions missing but translation works**  
The dictionary API only gives English definitions. Non‚ÄëEnglish words may still translate.

**‚ÄúNo translation found‚Äù**  
Try a simpler root form or fewer words.

**How do I clear old results?**  
Open settings ‚ûú Clear (Cache section).

**Can I use the keyboard instead of clicking?**  
Not yet. A shortcut is planned‚Äîfeel free to request it.

**Does it slow pages down?**  
It stays idle until you select text. Results are cached to reduce repeat calls.

**Dark mode automatic?**  
Currently manual. Toggle lives in settings.

**Want it inside iframes?**  
By default it skips them. Advanced users can remove the `@noframes` line in the script.

## Advanced (Optional)
Curious or tweaking? Near the top of `wordglance.user.js` there‚Äôs a small config block (limits, timeouts, page sizes). Most users never need to touch it.

---

## Privacy
Only the text you highlight is sent to the public APIs for meaning / translation. No analytics. Cache + preferences stay in your browser‚Äôs userscript storage.

---

## License
GPL‚Äë3.0 ‚Äì see the [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) file.
